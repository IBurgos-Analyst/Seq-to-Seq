This Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) model is a project completed during my graduate work at The University of West Florida. 
The goal is to feed this model text in a different language (Russian in this project) and have the RNN learn and translate it into English. 
In the process making a very simple form of a translator via text. 

The purpose of the project was to use an encoder-decoder model, which is commonly use in recurrent neural networks (RNN) to encode input (source) into a single vector.
Single vector in this notebook is also refered to as a context vector. 
Think of a context vector as an abstract representation of an entire input sentence.
